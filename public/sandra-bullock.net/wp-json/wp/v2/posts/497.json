I want him to experience all culture, nationalities, countries and people like I did. I want his mind to be open and free. We were raised that we are all the same. No one greater, smarter, more powerful. We are all equal. I would love for Louis to know that . He has a big, beautiful, diverse family. As long as he know he is loved and protected and given the opportunity to touch and see everything, then I will have done my job as a mama.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>3) But did Sandra know about the Nazi stuff?<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The photo shocked me and made me sad. This is not the man I married. This was stupid, this was ignorant. racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, homophobia, anything Nazi and a boatload of other things have no place in my life. And the man I married felt the same. This I hope Jesse will address one day, but that is not the world I live in or have ever lived in and have any tolerance for.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Just to remove any lingering doubts, Sandra also mentions that Louis had a bris:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A friend of ours helped arrange for a bris [Jewish circumcision ceremony] at the house, because we couldn&#8217;t go [to a hospital for the procedure]. The mohel [a person trained in the practice] came to us. You have never seen adults more panicked about what was about to happen to their son, but the celebration and the amount of love we felt and the pride in the little man whom we love so, so much became the greatest moment I have ever had in my life.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/jezebel.com\/5526658\/5-biggest-questions-about-sandra-bullock-and-her-baby\" target=\"_blank\">Jezebel<\/a> with a big and pretty photo of Louis.<\/p>\n<p>Is there a caption that me, as a mom, totally understand. <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Milk dribbles down and gets stuck in the folds of his neck.

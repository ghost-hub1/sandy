I had to be buck-naked. The big thing was that it was funny. And the only way it could be funny was if you saw my whole body. Ann Fletcher, the director, was amazing in how she choreographed it because we knew we couldn&#8217;t show anything too explicit. I had a little bit more area to cover than Ryan did, so it was a little trickier for me. But I can talk about Ryan&#8217;s penis if you want. I mean if I looked like him, I&#8217;d be naked all the time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What you won&#8217;t see on the big screen.<br \/>\n&#8220;You have things covering up your essential parts but they get unstuck. And, oddly enough, we didn&#8217;t care because we were so tired. Ann was like, &#8216;Sandra, your vagina is hanging out. Cover it up.&#8217; I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Oh, sorry, sorry.&#8217; And the crew would be like, &#8216;Jeez, her nipple is showing.&#8217; They weren&#8217;t titillated, they were unhappy because they knew we had to retake the shot. They&#8217;re like, &#8216;We want to go to lunch. Cover the nip.&#8217; So that&#8217;s pretty much how the day went.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><spoiler>Getting felt up by Betty White.<br \/>\n&#8220;When you put it that way, I go, &#8216;God, we shot a soft porn.&#8217; Let me just say, Betty White feeling me up was the best second base I&#8217;ve ever had. She was tender yet firm, found them instantly, which is not easy. She was gentle and loving. And I felt satisfied afterwards.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The upside of playing a nasty boss.<br \/>\n&#8220;Having to be nice all the time is like&#8211; Oh, my god, it&#8217;s exhausting. For three months, I could be a bitch. And people would be like, &#8216;Why are you that way?&#8217; I&#8217;m like, &#8216;It&#8217;s my character. I&#8217;m in character. I don&#8217;t have to apologize for being this way. I take it home with me. I&#8217;m a bitch because I&#8217;m working as a bitch. It&#8217;s in my contract.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ryan dropping to his knee in the proposal scene.<br \/>\n&#8220;I just love the honor of it. It&#8217;s like placing yourself at someone&#8217;s feet and going, &#8216;Would you spend your life with me?&#8217; I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s how you should propose. But I think it probably dates back to some tradition between the kings and queens. I don&#8217;t know. Lord, someone look it up. Google it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One of the many things she loves about hubby Jesse James.<br \/>\n&#8220;He said something really smart. He said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t care if people don&#8217;t like me. They don&#8217;t have to like me and what I do.&#8217; And I was like, &#8216;Oh, my God. I want your job.&#8217; But he truly says what he thinks. And he owns his mistakes. And that&#8217;s a rare quality.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What she doesn&#8217;t love about his new TV show Jesse James is a Dead Man.<br \/>\n&#8220;I know he takes risks and I don&#8217;t need to know every detail. The women he&#8217;s got in his office are great because I get the information I need, and I don&#8217;t get the information I don&#8217;t want to know. But I don&#8217;t ever want him to not do what it is that he&#8217;s doing. There are moments when I go, &#8216;I can&#8217;t know. And I don&#8217;t want to know because I&#8217;m already a wreck.&#8217; But what he does do is extraordinary to me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Watching her man in action.<br \/>\n&#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;m there. I&#8217;ve seen an accident that he was in, where I was like, &#8216;All right. They&#8217;re coming to get me. The paramedics are here. The chaplains are here. He&#8217;s dead. I don&#8217;t care. I just want to know that I can take care of him.&#8217; But I&#8217;m a scaredy cat. He&#8217;s not. Somehow, we meet in the middle and it works.&#8221;<\/spoiler><\/p>\n<p>Trying to take life easy.<br \/>\n&#8220;I am like the queen of planning and scheduling. And I&#8217;m trying very hard to stop it. I just want to finish what I&#8217;m doing and go home. I want to have a weekend. I want to have breakfast, a stack of pancakes. I don&#8217;t want to not enjoy where I am at this very moment. So every time I plan something, the exact opposite happens. I hope I&#8217;m always satisfied and content like I am right at this very moment.&#8221; [<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nj.com\/celebrity-news\/index.ssf\/2009\/06\/sandra_bullock_ryan_reynolds_s.html\">Source<\/a>]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a two-year vacation from the big screen, Sandra Bullock is finally back in The Proposal, opposite that leading man women die for, Ryan Reynolds.

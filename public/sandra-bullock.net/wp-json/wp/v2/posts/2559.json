Bullock and Kidman are expected to produce alongside Denise Di Novi, who produced the original.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Practical Magic<\/em>\u00a0starred Kidman and Bullock as two orphaned sisters who come from a long line of witches. Raised by their eccentric aunts in a prejudiced Massachusetts town, they had to contend with a curse that kept them from never finding love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of release, the movie received generally negative reviews and failed to make a mark at the box office, but it has achieved cult status among audiences. Since the film\u2019s release, Kidman and Bullock have also become the two biggest stars in Hollywood with awards recognition and box office acclaim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t the first time Warners has tried to expand the\u00a0<em>Practical Magic<\/em>\u00a0universe. A prequel series,\u00a0<em>Rules of Magic<\/em>,\u00a0was in the works\u00a0at HBO Max from Melissa Rosenberg and was described as an epic, generational family drama that is set in 1960s New York City. It would have revolved around three troubled siblings \u2014 Franny, Jet and Vincent Owens \u2014 who wrestle with \u201cabnormalities\u201d that have kept them isolated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bullock was last in theaters with Paramount adventure rom-com\u00a0<em>The Lost City<\/em>, grossing over $100 million at the domestic box office. Kidman was most recently onscreen in Amazon series\u00a0<em>Expats<\/em>\u00a0and the Paramount series\u00a0<em>Lioness<\/em>\u00a0from\u00a0<em>Yellowstone<\/em>\u00a0creator Taylor Sheridan.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_3-0\">The Oscar winner confirmed the news in an\u00a0interview with PEOPLE\u00a0on Thursday, telling the outlet she and Bullock will return to their roles as sister witches Gillian and Sally Owens, respectively. &#8220;Yes I will be in it. And Sandy will be in it. And that&#8217;s that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more to tell which is why we go, &#8216;OK, this is kind of interesting now to be able to do this.'&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_5-0\">Kidman added, &#8220;[We] found a way in.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_10-0\">Warner Bros. first announce that a sequel to the 1998 witchy film was in the works earlier this week, and\u00a0<em>Entertainment Weekly\u00a0<\/em>confirmed that Kidman and Bullock were in talks\u00a0to return to their roles, as well as produce alongside the original&#8217;s producer Denise Di Novi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_12-0\">The sequel film is based on a screenplay by Akiva Goldsman, who co-wrote the screenplay for the first\u00a0<em>Practical Magic<\/em>\u00a0with Robin Swicord and Adam Brooks, based on the novel of the same name by author Alice Hoffman. The beloved film followed sister witches Sally and Gillian, who were raised by their eccentric aunts (played by\u00a0Stockard Channing\u00a0and\u00a0Dianne Wiest)\u00a0after their parents died. They faced ages-old prejudices and one resurrection gone wrong, all while trying to find happiness in the face of a family curse that keeps killing their lovers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plot details about the sequel are being kept under wraps for now, but there is plenty of material to potentially pull from. In addition to the original 1995 novel, there are three other books in the\u00a0<em>Practical Magic<\/em>series: prequels\u00a0<em>The Rules of Magic<\/em>\u00a0(2017) and\u00a0<em>Magic Lessons<\/em>\u00a0(2020), and sequel\u00a0<em>The Book of Magic<\/em>\u00a0(2021). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_21-0\">Additionally, in 2019, HBO Max (since rebranded to Max) ordered a 1960s-set\u00a0pilot for a\u00a0<em>Practical Magic<\/em>\u00a0prequel series\u00a0focusing on the aunts, Franny and Jet. However, that project ultimately never materialized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"mntl-sc-block_23-0\">In addition to Kidman, Bullock, Channing, and Wiest, the original film also starred\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ew.com\/person\/evan-rachel-wood\/\">Evan Rachel Wood<\/a>, Aidan Quinn, and Goran Vi\u0161nji?. Further casting for the sequel has not yet been announced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman will also executive produce the sequel as well. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get the midnight margaritas ready.

During the discussion she talked about how she hates selfies.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>She might be America&#8217;s sweetheart, but even Sandra Bullock has her limits \u2013 especially when it comes to social media. <\/p>\n<p>The Our Brand Is Crisis star, 51, says she cringes at the idea of posting a slew of happy selfies for the world to &#8220;like,&#8221; because the image they project simply isn&#8217;t reality. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not representing our lives truthfully,&#8221; she tells U.K.&#8217;s The Times. &#8220;Like when you&#8217;re yelling at your child, you&#8217;re not taking a selfie of you being a horrible parent. No, you&#8217;re waiting for the perfect selfie. &#8216;Do I look thinner now?&#8217; &#8216;Do I look great?&#8217; It&#8217;s this false projection of one&#8217;s life. Hollywood has now gone global. Everyone&#8217;s Hollywood now.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Bullock, who recently adopted daughter Laila, 3 \u00bd (she joins brother joins son Louis, who turns 6 this month), turns up her nose at the idea of the &#8220;selfie generation.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I hate taking selfies,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I will not take a selfie that I can&#8217;t erase. I don&#8217;t post or do any of that stuff.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean the star is against taking family snapshots \u2013 privately. <\/p>\n<p>Last week, the mother of two picked up a People&#8217;s Choice Award for favorite movie actress, and told the audience she keeps a trove of family videos on her smartphone. (She explained that Louis thought he should get an acting award for his starring role in the home movies.) <\/p>\n<p>Bullock also told The Times that in the age of oversharing, less can often mean so much more. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People have these worlds they post and it&#8217;s about projecting an image and getting likes,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;I read a great article about how there&#8217;s a higher rate of depression because people are looking at everyone else&#8217;s Facebook [pages] and seeing this picture-perfect life. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s frightening for kids and young people developing who they are to have that false sense of acceptance based on an image,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;How do you unravel that when it&#8217;s being pushed hard?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.people.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Source<\/a>)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recently Sandra spoke with The Times UK about her new project Our Brand Is Crisis.

I know that. &#8216;Sandra Bullock&#8217;s way past 40.&#8217; Yeah, I know that, too \u2026 &#8216;There&#8217;s absolutely nothing special about her acting. She&#8217;s not particularly attractive, I can&#8217;t stand her, she&#8217;s mediocre. She&#8217;s over 40.&#8217; And apparently Julia [Roberts] \u2026 You and I are in a dispute over George Clooney. We talked about this, right? It&#8217;s shared custody and we&#8217;re both fine with it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Going off of that, Bullock \u2013 who hasn&#8217;t publicly dated anyone since her divorce from cheating ex-husband Jesse James \u2013 also touched on relationship rumors.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[There were] lots and lots of comments about who I&#8217;ve dated. Some are true and some I&#8217;ll never admit to,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>One person she didn&#8217;t necessarily date, but revealed she had a moment \u2013 of sorts \u2013 with? A fellow awards season regular.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I was reminded I made out with Meryl Streep,&#8221; Bullock revealed of her online dirt. &#8220;Off-screen, not necessarily her choice. I kind of took her by surprise.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But behind all the jokes and silly revelations, the actress, most importantly, acknowledged: &#8220;Some commenters thought I had good hair and good teeth. And I made some young girls and some over 40 girls laugh with some chick flicks. I sparked with Betty White and I&#8217;ve flown into space. I&#8217;ve had a pretty good life and a pretty good career.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.people.com\/people\/article\/0,,20772401,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">People<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sandra Bullock is no stranger to the Internet.

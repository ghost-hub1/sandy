As Bullock recalled, it was on the set of a movie she made 10 years ago, which she didn\u2019t name. :\u201dIt was the worst experience I ever had,\u201d Bullock said. Read her full story below.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Sandra Bullock: It\u2019s a bigger issue than money. I know we\u2019re focused on the money part right now. That\u2019s just a byproduct. I keep saying, \u201cWhy is it that no one is standing up and saying you can\u2019t say that about a woman?\u201d We\u2019re mocked and judged in the media and articles. Really, how men are described in articles versus women, there\u2019s a big difference. I always make a joke: \u201cWatch, we\u2019re going to walk down the red carpet, I\u2019m going to be asked about my dress and my hair while the man standing next to me will be asked about his performance and political issues.\u201d Once we start shifting how we perceive women and stop thinking about them as \u201cless than,\u201d the pay disparity will take care of itself. There\u2019s a much bigger issue at hand. I\u2019m glad Hollywood got caught.<\/p>\n<p>But Hollywood has always been at the forefront of pioneering a new road and a new movement. So it\u2019s a blessing that they got caught, and there are a lot of outspoken, narcissistic actors like myself who are very happy to talk about the issue and keep it alive.<\/p>\n<p>My mother basically raised me as, \u201cWomen can do everything men can do. Don\u2019t get married. Blaze your own trail.\u201d And I didn\u2019t think others thought any differently. I always thought we are all equal, and we are. I was actually doing a film about 10 years ago, and I found myself yelling and being angry. And I was like, \u201cWhat is happening to me?\u201d I was literally fearful. And I realized, it\u2019s because I\u2019m female. It dawned on me. At that day and age, at that point in my career, it was the worst experience I ever had.<\/p>\n<p>I was destroyed, because you can\u2019t unsee something. Was I so na\u00efve up to this point to actually think that I was on an equal level with everybody? It was the way I was being treated, because I was female, versus the way others were being treated. It took me a while. It took a year and a half, where I regrouped, and thought, \u201cOkay, this is an isolated case.\u201d I\u2019ve had other subtle experiences, but nothing that blatant. It was a big eye opener, because it wasn\u2019t just men on women. A lot if came from women as well. The blessing of that film was that it opened my eyes.<\/p>\n<p>I was just happy to be working, so you take it, especially in this business. Only like 1 or 2 percent of us get to do this job. I\u2019m not money oriented. I lucked into money most of the time. But money is the byproduct of everything. How do you explain to your son that the ERA hasn\u2019t passed? I want him to think I\u2019m the boss and women are equal, but I can\u2019t really support that in the outside world. I hope in my lifetime, for him, everything is a level-playing field. We can hope.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As part of this week\u2019s Variety cover story on income disparity for women in Hollywood, Sandra Bullock spoke about the first time she became aware that she was being treated differently at work because of her gender.

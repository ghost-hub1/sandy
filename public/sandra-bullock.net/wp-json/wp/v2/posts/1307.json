First the 49-year-old Oscar winner teamed up with the uproarious Melissa McCarthy in Paul Feig\u2019s winning buddy cop comedy The Heat. Then, as Dr. Ryan Stone in Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s Gravity, Bullock gives an emotionally naked performance that will likely earn her an Oscar nomination. Bullock\u2019s tremendous talent and range \u2014 to say nothing of the woman\u2019s trademark grace and good humor in good times and bad \u2014 is what earned her the top spot on our annual list of the most exciting performers in 2013.<\/p>\n<p>Bullock\u2019s one-two punch demanded a fair amount of give and take from the actor. When she signed on to The Heat Bullock didn\u2019t expect to be playing straight man to McCarthy\u2019s firehose-blast of a performance. \u201cOnce I realized that that drove the film I had to step back,\u201d she says. \u201cOtherwise I would\u2019ve been fighting for something that would\u2019ve ended up on the cutting room floor. It wasn\u2019t what I was hoping for but the end result was the success of the film and people liking us together.\u201d While Bullock nixes any talk of The Heat 2, she says she\u2019s keen for another project with her fast friend McCarthy. (Hollywood, get on this!) <!--more--><\/p>\n<p>She was a true collaborator on Gravity as well. It was her idea for instance that her character Dr. Ryan Stone was in a raw state of mourning for her dead child. (Originally, the script called for her character to have a child waiting for her back on Earth.) \u201cWhat if she had absolutely nothing to fight for?\u201d Bullock says she proposed. \u201cShe\u2019s lost a child, there\u2019s nothing back home, she\u2019s a person who\u2019s basically a machine. That was my idea and Alfonso was so open to it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And as for squashing talk of another Gravity, Bullock appreciated Cuaron\u2019s alternate ending idea of George Clooney falling from the sky on top of her at the end. \u201cThe last scene you just see us on top of each other, limbs everywhere,\u201d she imagines with a laugh. \u201cOur hands intertwine with our last breath of air and we die on top of each other clutching the Earth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sandra Bullock is joined by 15 more Entertainers of the Year, including the masterminds behind Breaking Bad, Dallas Buyers Club star Matthew McConaughey, girl on fire Jennifer Lawrence, a very Grumpy Cat, and more. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sandra is on the cover of EW Entertainers of the Year issue, on stands tomorrow, November 26.

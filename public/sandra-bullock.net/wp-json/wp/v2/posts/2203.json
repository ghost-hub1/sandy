But even though the plot was darker than their previous movie, Paulson, 43, and Bullock, 54, still managed to bring comedy to the thriller, out Dec. 21.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>They are a bit like sisters. Like between takes, they were talking one time and I was like, \u2018Hey girls, I\u2019m actually trying to direct you!\u2019 <\/em>\u201d director Susanne Bier tells PEOPLE in the latest issue. \u201c<em>It was hugely important that there be a sense of humor in it, that it wasn\u2019t gonna be a just entirely dark, scary film.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Luckily for Bier, Paulson and Bullock already came in with a chemistry that will have viewers laughing within seconds of their first scene together.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You had a very strong feeling of something beyond the friendly relationship between actresses,<\/em>\u201d Bier says. \u201c<em>There is a real strong connection between the two of them and they had a lot of fun. And I think that\u2019s exactly what you see in the movie, there\u2019s a very direct understanding of one another.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But the movie is still very much a suspenseful thriller, filled with the mystery of what exactly is causing people to lose their minds. For reasons we won\u2019t spoil here, people learn they must wear blindfolds when they go outside \u2014 and Bullock took this seriously.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Sandy had a consultant who is someone who teaches people who have recently become blind, and helped her understand how to navigate a world where you can\u2019t see,<\/em>\u201d Bier reveals. \u201c<em>She was really blindfolded. She\u2019s such a dedicated and fearless actress that she was really blindfolded. It helped her tremendously.<\/em>\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>People has the first look of Sandra Bullock in Bird Box, that will be released next December 21.
